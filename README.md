# Postgres Lock Explainer

This site represents the documentation and resources I wish existed when I was learning about locks.

## My site's goal is to

1. Explain locks conceptually
2. Review monitoring tools
3. Troubleshoot common issues
4. Outline real world examples of how locks impact projects

The whole project took a lot of effort to complete, so I hope you find it insightful. I also added a lock blocker tool that shows what operations interfere with others:
